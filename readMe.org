OVERVIEW


This is an implementation of the rsa algorithm; currently, it can only encrypt strings of length 1. I will be working to solve this issue.

BUILT WITH

Emacs

mit-scheme


HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM

Mac

install homebrew via the command line;

install mit-scheme using homebrew; like this: brew install mit-scheme

install emacs using homebrew; like this: brew cask install emacs

Once you install mit-scheme and emacs you should be able to invoke mit-scheme in emacs
with the command M-x run-scheme. If you can't go to the terminal and type `which mit-scheme`.
`which mit-scheme` will give you the location where mit-scheme was stored; lets call this
location E.

   (setq scheme-program-name "E")
   
Example: 
If I type `which mit-scheme` in my terminal I get: 

       /usr/local/bin/mit-scheme.
       
I then go to my emacs file and type:

   (setq scheme-program-name "/usr/local/bin/mit-scheme")

This should invoke mit-scheme in Emacs.

Once you have done you can run the program by invoking mit-scheme and loading the file; like so

   (load "file.scm").
